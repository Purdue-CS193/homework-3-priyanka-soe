Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
HI, this is a message to myself. 

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
Git fetch gets ("fetches") any new information from the remote server (Github) and updates it in our local server. 
Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
Git represents our local repository on our own machine that we can write changes to, while Github is the central repository anyone on the project can access / write changes to.
