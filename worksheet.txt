Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
git add, git commit, git push

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
Copies the repository from Github to your local machine. 

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
Returns the current state of your repository (aka if you are behind (haven't pulled) or ahead (have changes that are not pushed yet) of the main branch) 

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
The files on your local machine are the same that are in the remote repository AKA you are up to date with all new files in the repo and have not changed anything on your local machine either. 

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
git fetch

Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
Yes, because you never ran git push so you never pushed your changes to the remote repo, so the remote repo doesn't know anything about any of the changes you made yet. So all your old code is still there. 

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
Yes, as long as nothing happened to the remote repo, because since you never ran git push, you never connected your local changes to the remote repo so the remote repo has no idea what happeend.
